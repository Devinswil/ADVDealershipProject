# Dealership Application

## Description of the Project

This version of my application allows for me to generate contracts for buyers of my vehicles. These contracts will be saved into a contract inventory. Also, the final price on the vehicle will be dependent on financing or leasing and the cost of the car.



## User Stories

-As a user I would like to have the ability to offer buyers contracts on vehicles.
-As the buyer I would like to be able to buy a car.
-As the buyer I would like to be able to lease a car.
-As a user I would like to keep an inventory of all the contracts that have been made.
-As a user I would like to be able to buy a vehicle on the main menu of the application.

## Setup

The application while ask for an input with corresponding action. Once given an input it will display a filtered version of the inventory, will prompt to add or remove vehicle. In addition it will ask users if they would like to buy and vehicle and route they would like to do so. Rather that be financing one or leasing.
